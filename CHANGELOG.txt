Current status:
Created class to represent chords, with a library of common (and uncommon) chords in chords.py.
chordTester.py asks for a root note and outputs a bunch of information about the chords and notes 
in the keys with that root note.

Next step:
Create writeChord() function, which will write a given chord to a MIDI file.
writeChord(chord, inv, oct, len)
